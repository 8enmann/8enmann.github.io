I'm a software engineer in San Francisco. 

Back in 2010, I read a character recognition textbook and tried to make an [offline Chinese recognition/translation app for Android](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51010304-ben-mann) with my brother and some classmates. Phones weren't quite powerful enough back then, though, so the project lost steam. Regardless, that project represents my general optimism that we can create amazing new experiences with technology, and that certainly panned out at Google. At Google I did full stack development, including everything from UX design to infrastructure scaling. I was also Tech Lead/Manager of a team of seven engineers. See [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-mann) for more info.

I recently left Google to start a company. I'm currently hacking on side projects while I meet and evaluate potential cofounders.

Outside of work you may find me at Mission Cliffs or running in Golden Gate Park. I [love to read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51010304-ben-mann).
